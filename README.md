# Neware NDA File Converter

This tool provieds batch converting functionality from nda files to excel files with a simple GUI. Please download the application from the [release](https://github.com/fingertap/nda_to_excel_converter/releases) page.

## Usage

You should have installed a `BTSDAExReport.exe` somewhere in your computer to use this converter, which is the only dependency of this tool. Select it in the file browser.

Then, select the input folder and output folder path. All the files with `.nda` extension will get converted into excel files and saved to the output directory. If the directory does not exist, it will be created.

Finally, click convert and there you go.

For most users, you can leave the output format untouched and use the default `Custom` format. You can always use other supported format in the dropdown list.
